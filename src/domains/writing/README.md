# Writing Domain Configuration

## Overview

The Writing Domain Configuration adapts Guru's four revolutionary systems for creative writing, content creation, and literary work. This configuration enables writers to leverage AI-native intelligence for enhanced creativity and productivity.

## System Configurations

### 1. WritingHarmonicConfig (Harmonic Intelligence)

Adapts FFT/harmonic analysis for text structure and rhythm detection.

**Key Features:**
- **Text-to-Signal Conversion**: Transforms written text into analyzable signals encoding:
  - Sentence length and complexity
  - Emotional tone
  - Rhythmic patterns
  - Dialogue ratios
  - Narrative tension
  
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies five types of writing patterns:
  - `narrative`: Long-term story arcs (0.1-2.0 Hz)
  - `exposition`: Chapter/scene level (2.0-5.0 Hz)
  - `descriptive`: Paragraph level (5.0-10.0 Hz)
  - `dialogue`: Sentence level (10.0-15.0 Hz)
  - `action`: Word/phrase level (15.0+ Hz)

- **Writing Recommendations**: Generates suggestions based on harmonic analysis:
  - Narrative arc strengthening
  - Action/description balance
  - Dialogue enhancement
  - Rhythm variation
  - Emotional resonance

### 2. WritingQuantumConfig (Quantum Memory)

Implements probabilistic content generation with superposition states.

**Key Features:**
- **Content Superposition**: Generates multiple possible continuations:
  - Direct continuation
  - Metaphorical approach
  - Contrasting perspective
  - Stream of consciousness
  - Structured narrative

- **Quantum Fields**:
  - `narrative`: 5 dimensions (plot, character, setting, theme, style)
  - `character`: 4 dimensions (motivation, arc, voice, relationships)
  - `theme`: 3 dimensions (primary, secondary, subtext)

- **Wave Function Collapse**: Two modes:
  - User-driven: Based on specified criteria (theme, style, emotion)
  - Probabilistic: Weighted random selection

- **Memory Entanglement**: Tracks relationships between:
  - Thematic connections
  - Stylistic similarities
  - Emotional resonance

### 3. WritingTaskConfig (Living Task Forest)

Evolutionary project management for writing projects.

**Key Features:**
- **Project Organisms**: Living entities with:
  - Type (novel, short-story, article, essay, poetry, screenplay)
  - DNA (plot genome, character DNA, theme evolution)
  - Lifecycle stages (conception → outlining → drafting → revision → final)
  
- **Chapter Evolution**:
  - Fitness calculation based on:
    - Coherence (25%)
    - Pacing (20%)
    - Character development (20%)
    - Theme resonance (15%)
    - Reader engagement (20%)
  - Mutations: split, merge, reorder, expand, compress, transform
  - Energy system driving lifecycle progression

- **Character DNA**:
  - Traits with mutability factors
  - Character arcs with trigger conditions
  - Voice profiles
  - Relationship dynamics
  - Evolution tracking

- **Plot Genome**:
  - Structure types (linear, nonlinear, circular, parallel, mosaic)
  - Act organization
  - Conflict management
  - Plot twist tracking
  - Pacing profiles

### 4. WritingLearningConfig (Adaptive Learning)

Multi-armed bandit optimization for writing strategies.

**Key Features:**
- **Writing Strategies**:
  - `The Architect` (planning): Detailed outlines, scene cards
  - `The Explorer` (discovery): Free writing, character interviews
  - `The Craftsperson` (structured): Three-act structure, daily goals
  - `The Adapter` (hybrid): Flexible outlines, sprint writing

- **Multi-Armed Bandit**:
  - Algorithms: epsilon-greedy, UCB, Thompson sampling
  - Contextual rewards based on:
    - Word count (30%)
    - Quality (40%)
    - Completion (20%)
    - Satisfaction (10%)

- **Adaptation Rules**:
  - `repeated_blocks`: Increase exploration
  - `consistent_success`: Reduce exploration
  - `deadline_pressure`: Switch to efficient strategies
  - `low_energy`: Use low-investment techniques

- **Context Awareness**:
  - Project type and genre
  - Deadline urgency
  - Writer experience level
  - Current mood and energy
  - Available time

## Integration Example

```typescript
import { writingHarmonicConfig } from './configs/harmonic-config';
import { writingQuantumConfig } from './configs/quantum-config';
import { writingTaskConfig } from './configs/task-config';
import { writingLearningConfig } from './configs/learning-config';

// Analyze text harmonics
const text = "Your writing sample here...";
const signal = writingHarmonicConfig.textToSignal(text);
const patterns = writingHarmonicConfig.interpretHarmonics(fftResult);
const recommendations = writingHarmonicConfig.generateRecommendations(patterns);

// Generate content possibilities
const superposition = writingQuantumConfig.createSuperposition(
  "Continue the story",
  "Previous context",
  previousStates
);
const collapsed = writingQuantumConfig.collapseWaveFunction(superposition, 'user', criteria);

// Manage writing project
const project = writingTaskConfig.createProject({
  type: 'novel',
  title: 'My Novel',
  genre: ['fantasy', 'adventure'],
  targetWordCount: 80000
});
const evolved = writingTaskConfig.evolveChapter(chapter, project);

// Optimize writing strategy
const state = writingLearningConfig.createInitialState();
const bandit = writingLearningConfig.createBandit(state.strategies);
const strategy = writingLearningConfig.selectStrategy(bandit, context);
```
