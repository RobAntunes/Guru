## Integration Points

### With Guru Enhanced
- Hooks into `analyzeCodebaseEnhanced` method
- Adapts analysis options based on selected strategies
- Learns from analysis results and timing
- Transfers discovered patterns as knowledge

### With Living Task Forest
- Learns from task evolution patterns
- Transfers confidence building patterns
- Creates insight-based tasks from learning outcomes
- Feeds back optimization recommendations

### With Existing Learning Systems
- Leverages QuantumLearningSystem for memory-based learning
- Uses EmergentBehaviorEngine for creative exploration
- Integrates with PatternDetector for code pattern recognition
- Connects with SelfReflectionEngine for performance analysis

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { GuruEnhanced } from '@/core/guru-enhanced';
import { createAdaptiveLearningSystem } from '@/adaptive-learning';

// Create enhanced Guru instance
const guru = new GuruEnhanced();

// Create adaptive learning system
const adaptiveLearning = createAdaptiveLearningSystem({
  guru,
  quantumLearning: new QuantumLearningSystem(),
  emergentBehavior: new EmergentBehaviorEngine(),
  config: {
    enableAdaptiveLearning: true,
    autoIntegration: true,
    feedbackLoops: true
  }
});

// Use Guru normally - adaptive learning works automatically
const result = await guru.analyzeCodebaseEnhanced(projectPath);

// Check learning status
const status = adaptiveLearning.getAdaptiveLearningStatus();
console.log(`Learning events: ${status.performance.learningEvents}`);
console.log(`Success rate: ${status.performance.successRate}`);
console.log(`Knowledge items: ${status.performance.knowledgeItems}`);
```

## Key Features

1. **Self-Improving**: Continuously learns from every analysis and adapts strategies
2. **Context-Aware**: Selects optimal strategies based on code complexity and uncertainty
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Shares insights between different analysis domains
4. **Performance Optimization**: Dynamically adjusts learning rates for optimal convergence
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Detects cyclic, progressive, and breakthrough patterns
6. **Meta-Learning**: Learns how to learn better over time
7. **Feedback Loops**: Automatic performance monitoring and adjustment

## Benefits
