# Flow Tracking and Type Analysis Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. **Flow Tracker** (`src/intelligence/flow-tracker.ts`)
- Analyzes control flow, data flow, exception flow, and async flow through code
- Builds flow graphs with nodes (source, sink, transform, branch, merge) and edges
- Detects flow issues: unreachable code, infinite loops, race conditions, null flows
- Calculates flow metrics: cyclomatic complexity, branching factor, path complexity

### 2. **Type Analyzer** (`src/intelligence/type-analyzer.ts`)
- Deep TypeScript/JavaScript type analysis with full type extraction
- Tracks type flow through assignments, parameters, returns, and narrowing
- Detects type issues: implicit any, type mismatches, circular dependencies
- Integrates with symbol graph for enhanced context

### 3. **Integrated Flow-Type Analyzer** (`src/intelligence/integrated-flow-type-analyzer.ts`)
- Combines flow and type analysis with symbol graph and harmonic data
- Enriches flow nodes with:
  - Symbol information (name, type, complexity, usage, dependencies)
  - Harmonic context (pattern, confidence, resonance, field strength)
  - Type context (declared type, inferred type, type flow)
- Generates integrated insights for code improvement

### 4. **Enhanced Guru** (`src/core/guru-enhanced.ts`)
- Extends core Guru with flow and type analysis capabilities
- Provides methods for:
  - Enhanced codebase analysis with flow/type/harmonic integration
  - Function-specific analysis with full context
  - Variable flow tracking with type evolution
  - Task discovery insights for Living Task Forest
  - Comprehensive code health metrics

### 5. **Living Task Forest Integration**
- Updated `GuruDiscoveryEngine` to use enhanced analysis
- Converts flow and type issues into actionable task insights
- Categories:
  - **Flow Issues**: Control flow problems, complexity, dead code
  - **Type Issues**: Type safety problems, implicit any, mismatches  
  - **Optimization Opportunities**: Performance improvements
  - **Refactoring Candidates**: Code structure improvements

## Key Features

### Flow Analysis Capabilities
- **Control Flow**: if/else, switch, loops, try/catch analysis
- **Data Flow**: Variable assignments, parameter passing, returns
- **Exception Flow**: Error propagation, try/catch/throw patterns
- **Async Flow**: Promise chains, async/await, concurrency issues

### Type Analysis Capabilities  
- **Type Extraction**: Full TypeScript type information
- **Type Flow**: Track how types change through code
- **Type Issues**: Detect safety problems and suggest fixes
- **Symbol Integration**: Connect types to symbol graph context

### Integrated Intelligence
- **Enriched Context**: Each flow node has symbol, type, and harmonic data
- **Cross-Analysis**: Flow patterns inform type analysis and vice versa
- **Actionable Insights**: Convert technical analysis into developer tasks
- **Health Metrics**: Overall code health based on flow/type/harmonic factors

## Architecture

```

├── IntegratedFlowTypeAnalyzer
│   ├── FlowTracker (analyzes execution paths)
│   ├── TypeAnalyzer (analyzes type information)
│   └── Enrichment (adds symbol graph + harmonic context)
├── Symbol Graph (existing code structure)

```

## Usage Example

```typescript
const guru = new GuruEnhanced();

// Analyze entire codebase
const result = await guru.analyzeCodebaseEnhanced(projectPath, {
  enableFlowAnalysis: true,
  enableTypeAnalysis: true,
  enableHarmonicEnrichment: true
});

// Get task discovery insights
const insights = await guru.getTaskDiscoveryInsights(projectPath);
console.log(insights.flowIssues);        // Flow problems to fix
console.log(insights.typeIssues);        // Type safety issues
console.log(insights.optimizationOpportunities); // Performance improvements
console.log(insights.refactoringCandidates);     // Structure improvements

// Analyze specific function
const funcAnalysis = await guru.analyzeFunctionWithContext('myFunction', projectPath);
console.log(funcAnalysis.flowPaths);     // Execution paths through function
console.log(funcAnalysis.typeSignature); // Function type information

// Track variable flow
const varTracking = await guru.trackVariableFlow('myVar', filePath, projectPath);
console.log(varTracking.typeEvolution);  // How variable type changes
```

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Understanding**: Combines structure (symbol graph), behavior (flow), types, and patterns (harmonic)
2. **Early Issue Detection**: Finds bugs, type issues, and complexity before they become problems
3. **Actionable Insights**: Converts technical analysis into concrete improvement tasks
4. **Living Task Forest Integration**: Insights automatically spawn evolving tasks
5. **Code Health Metrics**: Quantifiable measurement of code quality

## Next Steps

The foundation is complete for flow tracking and type analysis. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Advanced Type Inference**: Better handling of complex generic types
2. **Security Flow Analysis**: Track tainted data and security vulnerabilities  
3. **Performance Flow Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. **Real-time Analysis**: Incremental updates as code changes
5. **Machine Learning Integration**: Learn patterns from codebase history

The system is designed to be emergent - as it analyzes more code, it learns better patterns and provides increasingly valuable insights.
