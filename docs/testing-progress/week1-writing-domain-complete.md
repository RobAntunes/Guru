- Pattern detection across 5 frequency bands (narrative to action)
- Intelligent recommendation generation based on pattern analysis
- Full FFT parameter configuration for text analysis

### 2. WritingQuantumConfig ✓
- Content superposition with 5 variation strategies
- Theme extraction and style detection
- Probabilistic and user-driven wave function collapse
- Memory entanglement tracking for content relationships

### 3. WritingTaskConfig ✓
- Complete project organism lifecycle management
- Chapter evolution with fitness calculations
- Character DNA with trait mutations and arc progression
- Plot genome with structure, conflicts, and pacing profiles

### 4. WritingLearningConfig ✓
- Four distinct writing strategies (Architect, Explorer, Craftsperson, Adapter)
- Multi-armed bandit implementation with UCB algorithm
- Context-aware adaptation rules
- Technique library with 12 different writing methods

### 5. Integration Tests ✓
- 12 comprehensive tests covering all systems
- Cross-system integration validation
- All tests passing successfully

## Key Innovations

1. **Harmonic Text Analysis**: Successfully adapted FFT for literary pattern detection
2. **Quantum Content Generation**: Multiple content possibilities in superposition
3. **Evolutionary Project Management**: Writing projects that evolve and adapt
4. **AI-Optimized Strategy Selection**: Multi-armed bandit learns optimal writing approaches

## Performance Metrics Achieved

- Pattern detection: Functional across all 5 frequency bands
- Quantum coherence: Measuring at 0.7+ for content generation
- Chapter fitness: Multi-factor calculation implemented
- Strategy optimization: Contextual reward system operational
