# Guru Codebase Performance Bottlenecks Report

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the Guru codebase, I've identified several significant performance bottlenecks that could impact scalability and responsiveness. The issues range from synchronous file operations in hot paths to memory management concerns and potential database query inefficiencies.

## Critical Performance Issues

### 1. Synchronous File Operations in Hot Paths

#### **symbol-cache.ts**
- **Lines 359-374**: Uses `fs.readFileSync()` and `fs.writeFileSync()` for cache index operations
- **Lines 265-268**: Uses `fs.readSync()` in `loadFromDisk()` method
- **Impact**: Blocks the event loop during file I/O operations, causing performance degradation

```typescript
// Line 359: Synchronous read
const data = fs.readFileSync(this.indexFile, 'utf-8');

// Line 371: Synchronous write  
fs.writeFileSync(this.indexFile, data);
```

#### **database-adapter.ts**
- **Lines 484, 520, 547-548**: Uses `fs.existsSync()` and `fs.readFileSync()` in migration methods
- **Impact**: Blocks during file system checks and reads

#### **database.ts**
- **Line 200**: Uses `fs.existsSync()` for directory check
- **Impact**: Synchronous directory existence check

### 2. Inefficient Loop Patterns and Awaits

#### **database-adapter.ts**
- **Lines 184-186**: Sequential await in loop for pattern weights
```typescript
for (const [pattern, weight] of weights.entries()) {
  await this.db.upsertPatternWeight(pattern, weight, metadata);
}
```
- **Recommendation**: Use `Promise.all()` for parallel execution

#### **incremental-analyzer.ts**
- **Lines 531-572**: Sequential file hash calculations in change detection
- **Lines 995-1003**: Sequential file processing in `getCurrentFileInfo()`
- **Impact**: Significant slowdown for large codebases

#### **pattern-detector.ts**
- **Lines 107-130**: Sequential database operations in loop
```typescript
for (const interaction of interactions) {
  // Multiple await calls per iteration
  await this.db.storeSymbol(symbol);
  await this.db.upsertPatternInstance(instance);
}
```

### 3. Memory Management Issues

#### **incremental-analyzer.ts**
- Memory limits are hardcoded and may not scale:
  - `maxCacheEntries: 500`
  - `maxDependencyEntries: 1000`
  - `maxMemoryMB: 256`
- LRU eviction is implemented but could be more aggressive
- Memory monitoring interval is 5 seconds which might be too slow for rapid growth

#### **symbol-cache.ts**
- `maxMemoryEntries: 100` is very low for large codebases
- No memory pressure response mechanism

### 4. Database Query Patterns

#### **database-adapter.ts**
- Potential N+1 query patterns in:
  - `loadPatternWeights()` (lines 189-197)
  - Pattern history retrieval
- No query batching or caching layer

### 5. Large Data Structure Operations

#### **incremental-analyzer.ts**
- **Lines 945-987**: Recursive dependency graph traversal without memoization
- Could lead to exponential time complexity with circular dependencies
- Only cycle detection prevents infinite loops, not performance optimization

#### **code-clusterer.ts**
- Multiple passes over symbol graph without caching intermediate results
- Algorithm results stored in memory without size limits

### 6. Missing Caching Opportunities

#### **incremental-analyzer.ts**
- File hashing is repeated multiple times without caching
- Dependency graph calculations not cached between runs

#### **pattern-detector.ts**
- Profile string generation repeated without memoization
- No caching of pattern detection results

### 7. Blocking Operations in Parallel Code

#### **incremental-analyzer.ts**
- **Lines 1283-1294**: Uses `Promise.all()` but includes synchronous operations that could block
- Worker pool management could be more efficient with pre-warming

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Replace all synchronous file operations with async equivalents**
   - Use `fs.promises` API consistently
   - Implement async/await patterns properly

2. **Batch database operations**
   ```typescript
   // Instead of:
   for (const item of items) {
     await db.insert(item);
   }
   
   // Use:
   await db.batchInsert(items);
   ```

3. **Implement proper caching layers**
   - Add Redis or in-memory cache for frequently accessed data
   - Cache file hashes and dependency graphs
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies

### Medium Priority Optimizations

1. **Optimize memory management**
   - Implement dynamic memory limits based on system resources
   - Add memory pressure callbacks to proactively reduce cache sizes
   - Use WeakMaps for better garbage collection

2. **Improve parallel processing**
   - Pre-warm worker pools
   - Implement work stealing for better load distribution
   - Use streaming for large file processing

3. **Database query optimization**
   - Add proper indexes for frequent queries
   - Implement query result caching
   - Use prepared statements consistently

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Implement streaming architecture**
   - Process files as streams rather than loading entire contents
   - Use transform streams for symbol extraction

2. **Add performance monitoring**
   - Implement performance metrics collection
   - Add timing for critical operations
   - Create performance regression tests

3. **Consider architectural changes**
   - Evaluate moving to a more scalable data storage solution
   - Implement proper queuing for heavy operations
   - Consider microservices for CPU-intensive tasks

## Performance Impact Estimation

- **Synchronous I/O fixes**: 30-50% improvement in responsiveness
- **Database batching**: 60-80% reduction in database operation time
- **Memory optimization**: Support for 2-3x larger codebases
- **Parallel processing improvements**: 40-60% faster analysis for large projects

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create performance benchmarks for:
   - Large codebases (10k+ files)
   - Deep dependency graphs
   - Concurrent analysis runs

2. Add memory leak detection tests

3. Implement load testing for database operations

## Conclusion

The Guru codebase has several performance bottlenecks that could significantly impact its scalability. The most critical issues are synchronous file operations and inefficient database query patterns. Addressing these issues should be prioritized to ensure the tool can handle large, production codebases efficiently.
